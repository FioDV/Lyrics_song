        Yeah, ah <br>
        Tell me what you really like<br>
        Baby I can take my time<br>
        We don't ever have to fight<br>
        Just take it step-by-step<br>
        I can see it in your eyes<br>
        'Cause they never tell me lies<br>
        I can feel that body shake<br>
        And the heat between your legs<br>

    <div class="bridge">
        You've been scared of love and what it did to you<br>
        You don't have to run, I know what you've been through<br>
        Just a simple touch and it can set you free<br>
        We don't have to rush when you're alone with me<br>

    <div class="chorus">
        I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>
        I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe<br>

        You are not the single type<br>
        So baby, this is the perfect time<br>
        I'm just trying to get you high (I'm just trying, baby)<br>
        And faded off this touch<br>
        You don't need a lonely night<br>
        So baby, I can make it right<br>
        You just got to let me try (try)<br>
        To give you what you want<br>
